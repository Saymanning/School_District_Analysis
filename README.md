# School_District_Analysis

## Overview

### Original Analysis
The purpose of the original School District Analysis was to provide data on the performance trends of reading and math standardized test data across 15 high schools to The School Board.
The following deliverables were provided in the analysis:

- A high-level snapshot of the district's key metrics, presented in a table format
- An overview of the key metrics for each school, presented in a table format
- Tables presenting each of the following metrics:
- Top 5 and bottom 5 performing schools, based on the overall passing rate
- The average math score received by students in each grade level at each school
- The average reading score received by students in each grade level at each school
- School performance based on the budget per student
- School performance based on the school size 
- School performance based on the type of school

### Purpose of this analysis:
The School Board discovered that the dataset analyzed, students_complete.csv file shows evidence of academic dishonesty; specifically, reading and math grades for Thomas High School ninth graders appear to have been altered. The school board does not know the full extent of the academic dishonesty, however they want to uphold state-testing standards and asked for the math and reading scores for Thomas High School be replaced with NaNs while keeping the rest of the data intact. After the math and reading scores were replaced with NaNs, the school district analysis was repeated to find if and/or how these changes affected the overall analysis.


## Results
Using bulleted lists and images of DataFrames as support, address the following questions.

- How is the district summary affected?
- How is the school summary affected?
- How does replacing the ninth graders’ math and reading scores affect Thomas High School’s performance relative to the other schools?
- How does replacing the ninth-grade scores affect the following:
- Math and reading scores by grade
- Scores by school spending
- Scores by school size
- Scores by school type

- The district summary
- The school summary
- The top 5 and bottom 5 performing schools, based on the overall passing rate
- The average math score for each grade level from each school
- The average reading score for each grade level from each school
- The scores by school spending per student, by school size, and by school type
